Summary
In this project, we:

Applied unsupervised learning algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering, GMM).

Performed dimensionality reduction using PCA and t-SNE for better visualization.

Evaluated the models and saved them using Pickle.

Built a Flask API to deploy the models for real-time predictions.

This project will demonstrate your ability to handle unsupervised learning tasks, perform data preprocessing, apply clustering algorithms, visualize results, and deploy machine learning models using Flask.
